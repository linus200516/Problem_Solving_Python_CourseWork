# Problem_Solving_Python_CourseWork
This is part of one of my first modules, where we learned how to use different things in python to solve problems given to us in Jupyter, which are all related to the two main rules within the sport "squash" refered as to PARS and ENGLISH rules.

What i learned:

I learned how to come with averages.

I learned how to use the csv module to read a file and output data in desired outcome.

I learned how to take the previous data and plot it into a graph, using the matplot lib module.

I learned how to take previous functions and run simulations of them, to get an average.
